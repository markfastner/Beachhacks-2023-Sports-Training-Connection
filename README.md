Welcome to the Sports Training Connection App repository! This app was created during the Beach Hacks hackathon competition and is designed to connect sports trainers and trainees, providing a platform for them to communicate, share information, and arrange training sessions.

Features
User Creation, Authorization, and Authentication: Users can create accounts, login, and logout securely using Firebase for the backend.

Google Maps API: We utilized the Google Maps API to provide a real-world map that allows sports trainers and trainees to connect and identify suitable locations for training.

Messaging System: A framework for a messaging system is provided, enabling communication between trainers and trainees.

Information System: Allows users to share and access relevant information such as training schedules, availability, and skills.

Recommendation System: Provides recommendations to users based on their preferences, skills, and goals.

Technologies Used
ReactJS: The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: This library was used to implement client-side routing and improve the user experience.

Firebase: Used for the backend of the application, handling user creation, authorization, and authentication.

Google Cloud: Used to develop an authorization process, ensuring secure access to the website.














# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
